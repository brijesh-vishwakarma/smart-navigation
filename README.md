# Command Palette - Angular demo

This is a minimal Angular project scaffold (standalone components) with a global Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd+K) that:
- searches across routes & sections
- navigates to route and highlights a section
- supports keyboard navigation

To run locally:
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Serve: `npx ng serve --open` or `npm start`

If you upload this zip to StackBlitz, it should unpack and run in the online editor.
